  NeuroMCP-Agent is a comprehensive AI framework for detecting 7 neurological
  diseases using EEG signals. It features an Ultra Stacking Ensemble with 15
  classifiers, 47 EEG features, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agent
  integration, and a 46-module Responsible AI framework with 1300+ analysis types.
  The framework achieves 87.6% average accuracy using Leave-One-Subject-Out
  Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) with comprehensive RAI governance.
