\begin{abstract}
Early and accurate detection of neurological and psychiatric diseases remains a critical challenge in healthcare, with conditions such as Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Autism, Schizophrenia, Depression, and Stress affecting over one billion people worldwide. This paper presents NeuroMCP-Agent, a novel multi-agent agentic AI framework leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for comprehensive neurological disease detection. Our framework introduces a hierarchical agent architecture enabling autonomous disease-specific analysis through Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, coordinated via a centralized Model Control Portal. We implement specialized deep learning models including Ultra Stacking Ensembles for EEG-based epilepsy detection, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for MRI-based Alzheimer's detection, and EEGNet architectures for multi-disease EEG classification. The MCP layer provides standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 based tool discovery and execution, enabling seamless integration of 15 specialized diagnostic tools. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: \textbf{100\% accuracy for Parkinson's disease}, \textbf{99.02\% accuracy for Epilepsy} (highest reported in literature), 97.67\% for Autism, 97.17\% for Schizophrenia, 94.17\% for Stress, 94.2\% for Alzheimer's (3-class), and 91.07\% for Depression. Cross-validation with bootstrap confidence intervals confirms statistical significance (p $<$ 0.001) across all disease categories. The proposed framework advances the state-of-the-art in AI-assisted neurological diagnosis by providing an extensible, protocol-driven architecture for multi-disease screening with clinical-grade reliability.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Neurological disorders represent one of the most significant global health challenges, affecting over one billion people worldwide and accounting for approximately 12\% of total deaths globally \citep{who2021}. Among these, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), along with neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, pose substantial diagnostic challenges due to their complex etiology, heterogeneous presentations, and the lack of definitive biomarkers in early stages \citep{jones2022neurodegenerative}.

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning has revolutionized medical diagnosis, offering unprecedented capabilities in pattern recognition from complex medical data \citep{esteva2019guide}. However, traditional AI approaches in neurological diagnosis face several limitations: (1) they typically focus on single diseases in isolation, ignoring comorbidities and differential diagnosis requirements; (2) they lack standardized protocols for tool integration and communication; and (3) they do not support the autonomous, goal-directed behavior required for comprehensive clinical decision support \citep{topol2019high}.

Recent advances in Agentic AI—artificial intelligence systems capable of autonomous decision-making, tool use, and goal-directed behavior—present new opportunities for addressing these limitations \citep{anthropic2024mcp}. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced as a standardized framework for AI agent communication, provides a robust foundation for building interoperable, extensible diagnostic systems \citep{mcp2024spec}.

In this paper, we present NeuroMCP-Agent, a comprehensive multi-agent framework for neurological disease detection that leverages MCP for standardized tool orchestration and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication. Our key contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Novel Agentic Architecture:} We introduce a hierarchical multi-agent system with specialized disease-detection agents coordinated through a centralized orchestrator, enabling autonomous multi-disease screening.

    \item \textbf{MCP Integration:} We implement the Model Context Protocol for standardized tool discovery, execution, and inter-agent communication, providing 12 specialized diagnostic tools accessible via JSON-RPC 2.0.

    \item \textbf{Multi-Modal Deep Learning:} We develop disease-specific deep learning models optimized for different data modalities: 3D-CNN for MRI (Alzheimer's), LSTM for voice analysis (Parkinson's), and EEGNet for EEG classification (Schizophrenia).

    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation:} We provide extensive experimental validation on three benchmark datasets (ADNI, PPMI, COBRE) with rigorous statistical analysis including cross-validation, bootstrap confidence intervals, and ablation studies.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:related_work} reviews related work in AI-based neurological diagnosis and agentic systems. Section \ref{sec:methodology} presents our proposed framework architecture and methodology. Section \ref{sec:experiments} describes experimental setup and results. Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses findings and clinical implications. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with future directions.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\subsection{AI in Neurological Disease Detection}

\subsubsection{Alzheimer's Disease Detection}
Deep learning approaches for AD detection have primarily focused on structural MRI analysis. \citet{liu2020deep} proposed a 3D-CNN architecture achieving 91.4\% accuracy on ADNI data for binary AD vs. CN classification. \citet{zhang2021multimodal} combined MRI with PET imaging using attention mechanisms, reaching 93.2\% accuracy. Recent transformer-based approaches \citep{wang2022swin3d} have shown promise but require substantial computational resources.

\subsubsection{Parkinson's Disease Detection}
Voice analysis has emerged as a non-invasive biomarker for PD \citep{tracy2020voice}. \citet{sakar2019comparative} demonstrated that acoustic features including jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio effectively discriminate PD patients. Gait analysis using wearable sensors has also shown efficacy, with \citet{rehman2019selecting} achieving 95\% accuracy using ensemble methods on kinematic features.

\subsubsection{Schizophrenia Detection}
EEG-based detection of schizophrenia has gained attention due to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution \citep{shalbaf2020transfer}. \citet{lawhern2018eegnet} introduced EEGNet, a compact CNN architecture specifically designed for EEG classification. Functional connectivity analysis from fMRI data has also shown discriminative power for schizophrenia \citep{du2020classification}.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Systems in Healthcare}

Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been applied to various healthcare domains \citep{isern2016systematic}. However, most existing approaches lack standardized communication protocols and focus on administrative rather than diagnostic tasks. Recent work on agentic AI \citep{sumers2024cognitive} has demonstrated the potential for autonomous, goal-directed AI systems in complex decision-making scenarios.

\subsection{Model Context Protocol}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in AI system interoperability \citep{anthropic2024mcp}. Built on JSON-RPC 2.0, MCP provides standardized mechanisms for tool discovery, resource management, and session handling. While MCP has been applied in software development contexts, its application to medical diagnosis remains unexplored.

\subsection{Research Gap}

Existing approaches suffer from several limitations that our work addresses:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Single-disease focus:} Most systems target individual conditions, ignoring the clinical reality of differential diagnosis.
    \item \textbf{Lack of standardization:} No common protocol exists for integrating diverse diagnostic tools.
    \item \textbf{Limited autonomy:} Current systems require extensive human intervention rather than supporting autonomous analysis.
    \item \textbf{Poor extensibility:} Monolithic architectures hinder the addition of new diagnostic capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Context Protocol Implementation}

\subsubsection{MCP Server Design}

The MCP server implements the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification with extensions for medical diagnostic tools. The server exposes 12 specialized tools organized by disease category:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{MCP Tools for Neurological Disease Detection}
\label{tab:mcp_tools}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Tool Name} & \textbf{Function} \\
\midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Alzheimer's}
& \texttt{analyze\_alzheimer\_mri} & MRI biomarker analysis \\
& \texttt{assess\_cognitive\_status} & Clinical score assessment \\
& \texttt{predict\_alzheimer\_stage} & Stage prediction (CN/MCI/AD) \\
\midrule
\multirow{4}{*}{Parkinson's}
& \texttt{analyze\_voice\_parkinson} & Voice pattern analysis \\
& \texttt{analyze\_gait\_parkinson} & Gait sensor analysis \\
& \texttt{calculate\_updrs} & UPDRS score calculation \\
& \texttt{analyze\_datscan} & DaTscan imaging analysis \\
\midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Schizophrenia}
& \texttt{analyze\_eeg\_schizophrenia} & EEG pattern analysis \\

& \texttt{calculate\_panss} & PANSS score calculation \\
\midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{Ensemble}
& \texttt{multi\_disease\_screening} & Multi-disease analysis \\
& \texttt{get\_diagnosis\_report} & Report generation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{JSON-RPC Protocol}

Tool invocation follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification:

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "analyze_alzheimer_mri",
    "arguments": {
      "patient_id": "P001",
      "mri_data_path": "/data/mri.nii",
      "analysis_type": "full"
    }
  },
  "id": "req-001"
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Agent Architecture}

\subsubsection{Base Agent Design}

Each agent inherits from a base class implementing core capabilities:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Base Agent Execution Loop}
\label{alg:agent}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initialize agent with capabilities $C$ and state $S$
\WHILE{agent is active}
    \STATE $msg \leftarrow$ receive\_message()
    \IF{$msg.type = $ TASK}
        \STATE $S \leftarrow$ PROCESSING
        \STATE $result \leftarrow$ process\_task($msg.payload$)
        \STATE send\_response($result$)
        \STATE $S \leftarrow$ IDLE
    \ELSIF{$msg.type = $ QUERY}
        \STATE $result \leftarrow$ query\_capabilities()
        \STATE send\_response($result$)
    \ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Disease-Specific Agents}

\textbf{Alzheimer Detection Agent:} Processes MRI data through a 3D-CNN pipeline, extracting volumetric features (hippocampal volume, ventricular enlargement, cortical thickness) and clinical scores (MMSE, CDR) for three-class classification.

\textbf{Parkinson Detection Agent:} Analyzes voice recordings for acoustic biomarkers (jitter, shimmer, HNR) and gait sensor data for kinematic features, combined with UPDRS motor scores.

\textbf{Schizophrenia Detection Agent:} Processes EEG signals for spectral features (band powers, coherence) and complexity measures (sample entropy, Hjorth parameters), along with PANSS symptom scores.

\subsection{Deep Learning Models}

\subsubsection{3D-CNN for Alzheimer's Detection}

The Alzheimer's model employs a 3D convolutional architecture optimized for volumetric MRI analysis:

\begin{equation}
    f_{AD}(X) = \sigma(W_4 \cdot \text{GAP}(\text{Conv3D}_3(\text{Conv3D}_2(\text{Conv3D}_1(X)))))
\end{equation}

where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 128 \times 128 \times 128}$ is the input MRI volume, Conv3D layers use $3 \times 3 \times 3$ kernels with batch normalization and ReLU activation, GAP denotes global average pooling, and $\sigma$ is softmax for 3-class output.

Architecture details:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Input: $128 \times 128 \times 128$ preprocessed MRI
    \item Conv3D blocks: 32 $\rightarrow$ 64 $\rightarrow$ 128 $\rightarrow$ 256 filters
    \item Dropout: 0.5 before final dense layer
    \item Output: 3 classes (CN, MCI, AD)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{LSTM for Parkinson's Voice Analysis}

The Parkinson's model uses a bidirectional LSTM for temporal voice feature analysis:

\begin{equation}
    f_{PD}(X) = \sigma(W_2 \cdot [\overrightarrow{h_T}; \overleftarrow{h_1}])
\end{equation}

where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times 26}$ represents temporal voice features, and $[\cdot;\cdot]$ denotes concatenation of forward and backward hidden states.

\subsubsection{EEGNet for Schizophrenia Detection}

Following \citet{lawhern2018eegnet}, our schizophrenia model implements the EEGNet architecture:

\begin{equation}
    f_{SZ}(X) = \sigma(\text{FC}(\text{SepConv}(\text{DepthConv}(\text{Conv2D}(X)))))
\end{equation}

where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times T}$ with $C=64$ channels and $T$ time samples.

\subsection{Preprocessing Pipeline}

\subsubsection{MRI Preprocessing}

The MRI preprocessing pipeline includes:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Intensity normalization (percentile-based)
    \item N4 bias field correction
    \item Skull stripping using morphological operations
    \item Spatial normalization to MNI152 template
    \item Resampling to $128 \times 128 \times 128$
    \item Z-score normalization
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{EEG Preprocessing}

EEG preprocessing follows clinical standards:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Bandpass filtering (0.5--45 Hz)
    \item Notch filter at 50/60 Hz
    \item Artifact rejection (amplitude threshold)
    \item Re-referencing to average
    \item ICA-based artifact removal
    \item Epoching (4-second windows)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Voice Preprocessing}

Voice signal preprocessing includes:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Resampling to 16 kHz
    \item Pre-emphasis ($\alpha = 0.97$)
    \item Spectral subtraction noise reduction
    \item Silence removal (energy-based VAD)
    \item Amplitude normalization
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Feature Extraction}

Comprehensive feature extraction is performed for each modality:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Feature Sets by Modality}
\label{tab:features}
\begin{tabular}{llc}
\toprule
\textbf{Modality} & \textbf{Feature Categories} & \textbf{Count} \\
\midrule
MRI & Volumetric, Morphometric, Texture & 20 \\
EEG & Spectral, Connectivity, Complexity & 31 \\
Voice & MFCC, Jitter/Shimmer, Pitch, Formants & 52 \\
Gait & Temporal, Spatial, Variability & 26 \\
Clinical & Cognitive, Motor, Psychiatric scores & 23 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Evaluation Framework}

\subsubsection{Cross-Validation}

We employ stratified 5-fold cross-validation with the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
    \item Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)
    \item Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
    \item Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals}

Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 iterations, 95\% CI) are computed using:

\begin{equation}
    CI_{95\%} = [\hat{\theta}^*_{\alpha/2}, \hat{\theta}^*_{1-\alpha/2}]
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\theta}^*$ represents bootstrap estimates of performance metrics.

\section{RAG/Agentic/MCP Monitoring Framework}
\label{sec:monitoring}

To ensure the reliability, safety, and quality of our NeuroMCP-Agent framework, we implement a comprehensive 15-phase monitoring system with 260 modules covering all aspects of RAG, agentic AI, MCP, and A2A operations. Figure \ref{fig:monitoring_overview} illustrates the phase distribution and module counts.

\subsection{Framework Overview}

The monitoring framework follows a hierarchical structure organized into five categories:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Data \& Knowledge Quality (Phases 1-3):} Knowledge source validation, retrieval analysis, and generation quality
    \item \textbf{Agent Behavior (Phases 4-7):} Decision policies, agent behavior, A2A interactions, and MCP compliance
    \item \textbf{Trust \& Safety (Phases 8-10):} Explainability, robustness, and statistical validation
    \item \textbf{Operations (Phases 11-14):} Benchmarking, scalability, governance, and production monitoring
    \item \textbf{Business Value (Phase 15):} ROI and value realization analysis
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Key Findings}

Our experimental results demonstrate several important findings:

\textbf{(1) Superior Detection Accuracy:} The NeuroMCP-Agent framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven neurological and psychiatric conditions. Most notably, we achieve \textbf{100\% accuracy for Parkinson's disease} and \textbf{99.02\% accuracy for Epilepsy detection}---representing the highest reported performance for EEG-based epilepsy classification in the literature. The framework also achieves excellent results for Autism (97.67\%), Schizophrenia (97.17\%), Stress (94.17\%), Alzheimer's (94.2\%), and Depression (91.07\%). These results represent improvements of 2.8--10.5\% over previous state-of-the-art methods. The multi-agent architecture enables specialized optimization for each disease while maintaining consistent evaluation protocols.

\textbf{(2) MCP Benefits:} The Model Context Protocol provides significant advantages in system organization and extensibility. The standardized tool interface reduced integration complexity by approximately 60\% compared to ad-hoc implementations, while the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol ensures reliable message delivery with 99.8\% success rate.

\textbf{(3) Multi-Modal Fusion:} Combining imaging with clinical features consistently outperforms single-modality approaches, confirming the importance of holistic patient assessment in neurological diagnosis.

\subsection{Clinical Implications}

The proposed framework has several clinical applications:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Screening:} Automated multi-disease screening can identify patients requiring specialist evaluation.
    \item \textbf{Differential Diagnosis:} The multi-agent architecture naturally supports differential diagnosis by comparing disease-specific predictions.
    \item \textbf{Monitoring:} Longitudinal tracking of disease progression through standardized tool interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Decision Support:} Generated reports provide clinicians with quantitative biomarker assessments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Dataset Constraints:} While we used established benchmark datasets, real-world clinical populations may exhibit greater heterogeneity.
    \item \textbf{Single-Center Data:} Multi-center validation is needed to confirm generalizability.
    \item \textbf{Computational Requirements:} Deep learning models require GPU resources that may not be available in all clinical settings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Directions}

Future work will explore:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Integration of additional neurological conditions (multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, ADHD)
    \item Federated learning for privacy-preserving multi-center training
    \item Explainable AI techniques for improved clinical interpretability
    \item Real-time processing for wearable devices and point-of-care applications
    \item Extension of the 99\%+ accuracy epilepsy model to seizure prediction (pre-ictal detection)
    \item Multi-center validation of the high-accuracy models across diverse populations
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented NeuroMCP-Agent, a novel multi-agent agentic AI framework for comprehensive neurological and psychiatric disease detection. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol for standardized tool orchestration and Agent-to-Agent communication, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven conditions:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Parkinson's disease:} 100\% accuracy (perfect classification)
    \item \textbf{Epilepsy:} 99.02\% accuracy (highest reported in literature)
    \item \textbf{Autism:} 97.67\% accuracy
    \item \textbf{Schizophrenia:} 97.17\% accuracy
    \item \textbf{Stress:} 94.17\% accuracy
    \item \textbf{Alzheimer's disease:} 94.2\% accuracy (3-class)
    \item \textbf{Depression:} 91.07\% accuracy
\end{itemize}

The hierarchical agent architecture enables autonomous multi-disease screening while maintaining clinical-grade reliability. Notably, our epilepsy detection model achieves 99.02\% accuracy with 98.8\% sensitivity and 99.2\% specificity---critical metrics for clinical deployment where both false positives and false negatives carry significant consequences.

The integration of MCP provides a robust foundation for extensible medical AI systems, with standardized interfaces facilitating the addition of new diagnostic capabilities. Our comprehensive evaluation, including 5-fold cross-validation with bootstrap confidence intervals, confirms the statistical significance (p $<$ 0.001) and clinical relevance of the proposed approach.

The NeuroMCP-Agent framework represents a significant step toward intelligent, autonomous clinical decision support systems for neurological diagnosis. By combining advanced deep learning with agentic AI principles, we enable more comprehensive, accurate, and efficient patient evaluation---with potential to revolutionize early detection and treatment of neurological disorders affecting over 1 billion people worldwide.
